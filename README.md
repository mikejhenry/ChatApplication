# ChatApplication
Android app used to learn more about Kotlin Full Stack Application Development.

This particular application was very fun to work on and showed me a lot of features in Anroid Studio, and broke down how to set up a backend quickly and easily without having to
reinvent the wheel. 

Another part that I really liked about this application is that it allows you to manage different user accounts and allow the user's to login using their credentials, this was 
something I was always curious how people were implementing, obviously there is more than one way to implement this, but it's nice to get more exposure to some of the features 
that companies are looking for. 

The server communication aspect was the main reason I chose this video, I wanted to see a good example of not only tying your views together, and creating clean useful UI designs,
 but also working with a database backend. This has been a part of Software Development that I'm not as versed in, so I took the liberty of taking my personal time to get more
 familiar with these types of software solutions, and get more exposure so if/when I ultimately have to set up some backend features, I won't be blindsided by the technologies, and 
 be able to make more sense of the as is and to be states of a database communication and setting for managing data in the backend of our application.
 
 One small issue I ran into while creating this application is that inside of the conversation window, The individual messages are spaced out by almost and entire screen height. I 
 have been combing through my XML in order to try and find the one line of code that is causing this issue, but due to the fact the UI Design elements of android studio are fairly 
 new to me, I cannot seem to spot the code that is out of place, and because it's just a small cosmetic change, the application itself still runs and functions.
 
 I hope that in the near future I will find some reading or other content that makes understanding view manipulation a bit clearer, I will be looking into more projects to continue 
 to gain a better understanding of how all the different components of the app work together, and innovative ways to solve common problems engineers face when developing android
 applications.
